The perfect companion for projects with functional tests. Heavily inspired by the webdriver manager that ships with [protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor). WebDriver Manager allows you to keep Selenium Server binaries up to date as well as a packaged solution for easily starting Selenium Server up.
